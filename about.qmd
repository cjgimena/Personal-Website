# About

::: custom-font-2
Hi! I'm Clajerson (CJ) Gimena, a fourth-year Statistics & Data Science student at UCLA with a passion for applying data-driven insights to tennis analytics and real-world challenges.

Iâ€™ve worked as a performance analyst at the US Open Tennis Championships and contributed to the UCLA Tennis Consulting Club, supporting the UCLA D1 Menâ€™s and Womenâ€™s Teams. My self-taught tennis journey, combined with statistical expertise, helps me bridge data and strategy in sports.

Outside of data and tennis, I enjoy cooking, going to the gym, hiking, and exploring new places.\
sLetâ€™s connect! ðŸš€ðŸŽ¾
